                            <p class="lead">It all started with a recipe, a dream, and a suitcase full of memories from Naples, Italy.</p>
                            <p>In 1985, Tony DiMarco arrived in New York City with little more than his grandmother's pizza recipe tucked safely in his pocket and a determination to share the authentic taste of his homeland with his new neighbors in Greenwich Village.</p>
                            <p>Tony's grandmother, Nonna Maria, had run a small pizzeria in the heart of Naples for over 40 years. Her recipe was legendary in their neighborhood—a perfect balance of hand-tossed dough, San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella di bufala, and a secret blend of herbs and spices that created a sauce unlike any other.</p>
                            <p>When Tony first opened his doors on Bleecker Street, the space was small—just eight tables and a wood-fired oven that he had shipped from Italy. But what the pizzeria lacked in size, it made up for in heart. Word quickly spread through the Village about the new pizzeria where every pie was made with passion and every slice reminded customers of the cobblestone streets of old Naples.</p>
                            <p>Today, Tony's is run by Tony's two sons, Marco and Luca, who learned the craft from their father and continue to honor their great-grandmother's recipe. The pizzeria has expanded over the years, but the soul remains the same—family recipes, premium ingredients, and the same love for creating the perfect pizza that brought Tony to New York all those years ago.</p>
                            <p>When you visit Tony's, you're not just getting a slice of pizza—you're getting a piece of family history, a taste of tradition, and a connection to three generations of pizza makers who believe that food made with love tastes better.</p>
